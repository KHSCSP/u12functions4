# Exercise 1
# make a list containing a series of short text messages
# pass the list to a function named 'show_messages' which prints each text message (hint: for item in list)





# Exercise 2
# create a new (empty) list named 'outbox'
# create a function named 'send_messages', which receives two list parameters
# this function should print each message from your list and move the message to your 'outbox' list
# (remove it from the original list, add it to the 'outbox' list)
# after calling the function print both lists to make sure the messages were correctly moved
# note: you'll need to iterate through a copy of 'inbox' and remove!




# Exercise 3
# you'll need to redefine your list of text messages so that it is not empty
# and redefine your 'outbox' list to an empty list
# call your 'send_messages' function with a copy of your messages
# then print your lists to show that the original list has retained its messages




# Exercise 4
# write a function that receives a list
# and swaps the first and last items
